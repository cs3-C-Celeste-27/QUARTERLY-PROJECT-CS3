font-family:'Impact';"> Origins: Mr. House, whose real name is Robert House, is a pre-war businessman and technologist who played a crucial role in the development of the New Vegas Strip and the city of New Vegas itself. He is one of the few characters in the game who was alive before the Great War, having preserved his life through the use of advanced technology.
</p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;
font-family:'Impact';">Preservation: Mr. House survived the nuclear apocalypse by transferring his consciousness into a highly advanced computer network, which is housed in a secure underground facility within the New Vegas Strip. He has maintained his existence for centuries, making him one of the oldest characters in the game.</p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;
font-family:'Impact';">Influence and Control: Mr. House has significant control over the New Vegas area, including the New Vegas Strip and its surrounding territories. He has an extensive network of Securitron robots that enforce his rule and protect the Strip from outside threats. He also has a thriving business empire, including casinos and other enterprises.</p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;
font-family:'Impact';">Goals and Ambitions: Mr. House's primary goal is to protect and preserve New Vegas, as well as to maintain his own existence. He has a vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure New Vegas, free from the influence of external factions like the New California Republic (NCR) and Caesar's Legion.
</p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;
font-family:'Impact';"> Alignment Options: In Fallout: New Vegas, players can choose to interact with Mr. House in various ways. They can work with him, oppose him, or even attempt to take control of New Vegas for themselves. The player's choices can greatly affect the outcome of the game.
</p>
<p style = "font-weight: bold;
font-family:'Impact';">Character: Mr. House is characterized by his enigmatic and somewhat detached personality. He is highly intelligent and is focused on his own preservation and the preservation of the New Vegas area.</p>
